# How To Use the Interface

The interface has 5 tabs along the top. The tabs are labeled Play Queue, Song Info, Database, Playlists and Refresh On/Off.

Each tab displays a different part of the interface except the Refresh On/Off tab. The Refresh On/Off tab enables (On) or disables (Off) the automatic update of the Play Queue tab.

There is a seperate Readme file for each screen.

* [Play Queue](./playqueue.md)
* [Song Info](./songinfo.md)
* [Database](./database.md)
* [Playlists](./playlists.md)
* [Refresh On/Off](./refresh.md)

Some items can be customized. These items are listed in the [config file](./configfile.md).
